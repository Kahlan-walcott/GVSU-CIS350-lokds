# self.roll[0] += (self.dog_pos[0] - self.exhibit.get_width() / 2 - self.roll[0]) / 30
**Math Explain:** 
newCameraXPosition = currentCameraXPosition+((dogXPosition - (widthOfDisplay/2) - currentCameraXPosition)/30) 

*Why divide the width of the display by 2?*
Because it grabs the exact center of the x axis point of the players current display. 

*Why divide the new position by 30?*
Dividing by 30 slows down the overall rate of adjustment, giving the feel of a camera rolling across a screen as opposed to an instant change in view. 

For:
# self.roll[1] += (self.dog_pos[1] - self.exhibit.get_height() / 2 - self.roll[1]) / 30
Itâ€™s the same logic. Just with the vertical, y, up-down camera change.
